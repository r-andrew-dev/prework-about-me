      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I left my full time job as a content
          editor through a third party contact solutions
          company for Motorola Mobility in July. Since then I have been enjoying
          my time as a stay at home mom (SAHM) and doing a lot of 
          path searching.  </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born in Platteville, WI</p>

      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I love languages. I also have a little experience with coding as a content editor using HTML
         and enjoyed it very much. It feels like the right fit.
        I love technology and am excited by the rapidly changing environment this field provides. 
        I also want the flexibility to work remotely in order to provide the best options for my family.
